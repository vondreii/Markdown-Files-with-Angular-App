# angular-markdown

angular-markdown is a working example of an Angular App that iterates over multiple `markdown` files, displays a preview of them and opens each `markdown` file as a separate page. It can be used as a base for websites that use blogs/news/posts.

## To Run

Run `npm install` in the root directory.
Once completed, run `ng serve`.
Navigate to `localhost:4200` in a browser.
